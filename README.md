2.Make sure orders cancelled by customers should not be more than 7%
3.Make sure orders cancelled drivers should not be more than 18%
4.Also, increase the number of orders on weekends and match days. Keep match day by using the
following dates.
5.keep incomplete rides less than 6%
6.Keep order value high on weekends
